# largeScaleTransactionDataAnalysis
This project tries to demonstrate the application of PySpark for analyzing REC-SSEC Bank's
large-scale transaction data, comprising over 1 million rows. The analysis includes data pre-
processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms (Logistic
Regression and K-Means Clustering) to derive insights into transaction patterns for classifying
and segmenting data. which also addresses trends in transaction values and counts across
domains and locations. Performance optimization techniques, for example, caching and
partitioning were applied to enhance computational efficiency. Results include domain and
location-based transaction trends, prioritized domain activity, and clustering of transaction
patterns, underscoring PySparkâ€™s scalability and efficiency in handling big data tasks, with
performance optimization techniques further improving processing times. Findings tried to
underscore PySpark's distributed computing capabilities in handling large-scale datasets
efficiently. Moreover, key insights into the dataset were visualized using Seaborn and
Matplotlib. This work tried to understand domain-level and location-level banking trends in a
distributed computing environment.
